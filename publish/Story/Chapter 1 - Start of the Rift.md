[Azullia Ryea=blue, Taygetta=yellow]

< Azullia Ryea: | "Your Majesties, esteemed courtiers, I stand before all with matters of great importance, burdened with the scales of a heavy truths that resides within treachery. Potii Taygetta, Together with 3 distinguished nobles of Lynx —Lexius Necca and Semi Lya and the rotten greed Cheh Zardavee have collaborated in secret during the 4th Styx-Lynx War."

# The courtiers leaned forward, their curiosity piqued by Azullia's words. The air itself seemed to hold its breath, eager to hear the secrets that were about to be revealed.

< Azullia continued, her voice flowing like honeyed silk | "Their alliances have bid linerian along with songs to weaken our independence. his action have left our empire with tremendous price of political and costly economic reparations."

# The courtiers exchanged glances, procedded by the once silence room to disapproving noises, A hushed silence descended upon the court, the weight of Azullia's words hangs in the air.

< Azullia continued, | Oh, how our fate has intertwined in their destinies, Together, they conspired in deceit, encouraging Lynx's audacious bid to take back our independence, seeking to free themselves from the embrace of Styx's powerful influence. Alas, their actions have cast a lingering shadow of burden upon our noble empire, forcing us to endure the weighty reparations that still haunt our coffers."

# Whispers of disbelief rippled through the court as the gravity of the situation settled upon them. All eyes turned to Potii Taygetta, Potii Taygetta stood there, seemingly composed, yet his eyes flickered with a hint of unease. He understood the gravity of the situation, knowing that Azullia's silver-tongued rhetoric had placed him at the center of a narrative he might struggle to escape.

# Taygetta's eyes met those of Ciro Alycon, a signal mix of remorse and plea evident within them.

> Taygetta: | "Your Majesty, I stand before you with a heavy heart and a burdened conscience. I assure you, the accusations laid upon me are not as they seem. There are complexities at play, intricacies of loyalty and unforeseen alliances that I must shed light upon."

# Ciro Alycon's face displayed a myriad of emotions—doubt, concern, and maybe a glimmer of hope.

< Ciro Alycon: | "You ask for understanding, even as the evidence against you mounts. My heart is torn, for I cannot easily cast aside the bond we share. However, the accusations brought forth demand resolution, and the unity of our empire must take precedence."

# The court murmured with dissent, Zeurgeud, the known richest noble of the empire, voicing his discontent and demanding swift judgment.

> Zeurgeud: "Your Majesty, we cannot afford to stall. The betrayal is clear, and the empire's dignity must be restored."

# Julius Cato, the trusted commander of the empire, stepped forward with a measured tone. 

< Julius Cato | "Respected Monarch, I understand Zeurgeud's concerns, but we must tread cautiously. Potii Taygetta's position as 'The Ori' and the intricacies of his role in the Imperial Cult religion warrant a thorough investigation. Rushing to judgment may lead the [[The Common Onwixe (unwise)]] towards doubting your reigns."

> Ciro Alycon: | "I hear your concerns, Zeurgeud, and I value your counsel, Julius Cato. Yet, we cannot ignore the complexities of this situation. I request Lawbringer and hold a private audience with Noble Taygetta to hear his side formally. Only then can we make an informed decision."

# The court erupted into a mix of reactions, with most expressing dissatisfaction and others acknowledging Ciro Alycon's words. |

> Ciro Alycon: | "This matter requires careful deliberation, Let it be known that this court shall be paused temporarily.The court will then reconvene once we have gathered all relevant information. Noble Taygetta, I implore you to present any evidence or explanations that may sway my judgment. Until then, no judgement will pass."


# Ciro Alycon, burdened by conflicting emotions, watched as the court dispersed, the voices of nobles echoing through the grand chamber. The fate of Potii Taygetta, his cousin and a figure both revered and feared, now hung in the balance. He knows of his treacherous act and knew of his ambitious power hungry nature, yet, he wont be able to render judgement without bias, mainly not of its political consequences but rather his familial relationship with Taygetta, he won't able to imagine sons of Minerca would be held responsible for treachery and hanged in public like a commonner.
