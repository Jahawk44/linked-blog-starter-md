In a realm where shadows whispered secrets and the winds carried tales of forgotten lands, the lost knight, Wensbane, found solace in the dimly lit tavern. Glass after glass of ale, he consumed, seeking respite from the weight of his sorrow. A question escaped his lips, a plea for understanding, but the people around him brushed it off with jests and laughter. They could not comprehend the depths of his despair.

Amidst the raucous merriment, the barkeeper, a weathered soul who had witnessed countless stories unfold, interjected with a solemn tone. "He's a father of the immortal," he murmured, his voice carrying the weight of untold sorrows.

A stranger, drawn by the intrigue, inquired about the noble house that had taken Wensbane son. The barkeeper, with a flicker of sadness in his eyes, revealed, "The king. It is the king who sought his presence."

The stranger, contemplative, mused aloud, recognizing the anguish that lay beneath the surface. "To sacrifice a son for the realm one serves... It must be a heavy burden. But why is he here in [[Mineralia Magna|Magna]]?"

The barkeeper, his voice laced with a tinge of knowing, replied, "He seeks distance from Continenta, from the very heart of the Empire Capital. For guilt, my friend, has a way of consuming even the bravest souls. It claws at him relentlessly."

Caught in the swirl of emotions, the lost knight, his identity concealed by shadows, could not help but interject into the conversation. "One must forget who they are," he murmured pensively, his words veiled in a haunting wisdom.

"The Cost of Immortality," he continued, his voice carrying the weight of countless unspoken truths. The silence that followed was heavy with unspoken empathy.

"I am [[Balleon Wensbane]]," he finally revealed, his voice laced with a mixture of pain and determination. "My son is [[Ciro Alcyon II|Nabeon Wensbane]], at least that's the name before they took him."

Now they called him [[Ciro Alcyon II]] how did it happen? my loyalty to the emperor was unquestionable. [[Factions/The Ori|Father]] gifted my son to be part of the [[Styx Empire|Heaven]] serving the empire as its ruler for eternity while he must forget that I was his father and as I aswell to remember him as my son.

I was a fool, to give away my only memory of her, while others struggled to give away theirs. but none of it matter; the heaven takes what it wants. and [[The Mothers]] take theirs.

Wensbane hears of all of Mercenary armies marching from Colonia to Continenta, to march against the Ruling Dynasty, soon the streets were filled with prices of every heads of Loyalist who still loyal to Tyrannite, hurried he tried to goes to Capital to saves his son, he gathers comrades of people who are loyal but the gathering is assaulted by Cassio own forces, now hes locked in prison for month until the [[Massacre of Tyrannt|events]] happened.

Wensbane's heart sank as he heard rumors of the Mercenary armies marching from Colonia to Continenta, their intent to overthrow the Ruling Dynasty. The streets buzzed with fear as such act never happened in their life and grandfather life. The loyalty of the remaining Loyalists who still stood with Tyrannite was being tested, with bounties placed on their heads.

Driven by a desperate need to save his son, Wensbane hurriedly made his way to sought out comrades, fellow loyal souls who believed in the Empire and were willing to fight for Honor. Together, they formed a clandestine gathering, united in their determination to protect the Empire while Nabeon still there.

But their gathering were assaulted by the very own heaven. Cassio's own forces launched a brutal assault on their gathering. Wensbane fought valiantly, his sword clashing against his enemies, but outnumbered and overwhelmed, he was captured and thrown into a grim cell.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as Wensbane languished in the confines of his prison. The weight of his guilt and the ache of separation from his son gnawed at his soul. Yet, a flicker of hope remained, fueling his determination to defy the chains that held him captive.

Little did Wensbane know that the events that would shape his destiny were already set in motion. The wheels of fate were turning, and as he languished in darkness, a wave of changes was brewing on the horizon. The hour of reckoning approached, promising both redemption and new challenges.

In the depths of his prison, Wensbane clung to the memory of his son, Nabeon, and the love that bound them. With every passing day, his resolve grew stronger, ready to face the trials ahead and reclaim what was rightfully his.
