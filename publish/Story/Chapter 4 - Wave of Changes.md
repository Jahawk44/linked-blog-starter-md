Months follow, an entire continent is mobillized towards war. Disgruntled Noble from Cassio and Cellesela, leaded by Rhagaian banner attempt coup against Tyrannite 

>Azullia Ryea: (clenching her fists) Our cause is just, for we seek to restore honor to our land. We shall bring retribution upon those who have dared to betray us. With my guidance and the aid of other noble houses, we shall strike at the heart of the Tyrannite's power.

Who cames to our call?
Rhagaian Messanger: all but Gaius, your majesty

Azullia: the old cato..., the fool..

>Martius Umbra: i have prepared for this moment, Sis
the Guild have prepared new Siege Devices to punish the Gaius Main Army

>Azullia: The preparation need to be soon their armies are three times larger than all house combined ,luckly Cassio deep pocket able to reach mercenary from Colonia



the noble conspirators turned to the realm of mercenaries, where swords and loyalty were readily available for the right price. Private armies were moving from Colonia to Continenta, their ranks swelling with mercenaries seeking their own moment of glory and power. The tension mounted, a tempest of unrest brewing beneath the surface.

**Within the Palace of House Cellesela, All the Lady gathered to discuss the pressing matter at hand.**

>Lady Luna Elysia: (calmly) Before we rush into war, have we exhausted all diplomatic routes? Perhaps we can negotiate with the Tyrannite or seek alliances with other noble houses who share our grievances.


>Octavia Vulp: (leaning forward, a touch of impatience in her voice) Luna, Cassio and Rhagaian already ammassing armies for war, they didnt want peaceful resolution anymore they want to overthrow Tyrannite rule.

>Alynna Cerrine: what would happen to our brother? hes currently stuck in Minerva while the entire continent want to swallow minerva whole.

>Octavia Vulp: our brother held down by Tyrannite, they asked for us to back down in the upcoming war, however if we didnt join this war then our brother fate are decided by Cassio and Rhagaia which are no better.

>Luna Elysia: oh have mercy Goddess Minerva, poor Creo.

**In Minerva Court**
>Julius Cato: Samulus i need you to gather all the armies to pretect the capital, i will gather our forces to stop Rhagaian armies to pass

>Samulus: Yes, Great Father
